The contact tools manage saved wallet addresses, enabling you to reference addresses by custom names instead of copying long hexadecimal strings. This reduces transfer errors and speeds up common operations.

## Overview

You can add, list, resolve, and delete contacts through natural language commands. All contact data is encrypted, tied to your wallet address, and syncs automatically across devices. When you reference a contact in any command, the assistant resolves it to the stored address.

## Examples

Adding:
```
"Add alice as 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e"
"Save 0x987... as hardware-wallet"
```

Querying:
```
"Show my contacts"
"What's alice's address?"
"List all contacts"
```

Using:
```
"Send 100 USDC to alice"
"Check hardware-wallet balance"
```

Removing:
```
"Delete contact alice"
"Remove hardware-wallet from contacts"
```

## Validation

Addresses are validated on save with checksum verification. ENS names are resolved to addresses before storage. Duplicate contact names are rejected.

## Security

Contacts are encrypted at rest, tied to your wallet address, and accessible only by you. Data syncs automatically when using the same wallet across devices.
