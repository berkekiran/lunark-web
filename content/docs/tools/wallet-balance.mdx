<DocImage title="Platform Balance" />

The platform balance tool returns your USD credit balance used for AI assistant interactions. This balance is separate from your on-chain token holdings and is consumed with each message based on input and output token usage.

## Overview

Platform credits cover all AI costs including balance queries, transfers, and general conversation. The system tracks consumption in real-time and displays remaining balance on request. Credits can be topped up through the platform interface.

## Examples

```
"What's my platform balance?"
"How much credit do I have?"
"Show my Lunark balance"
```

## Response

Returns balance in USD format: `$10.0000`. No gas fees or wallet approval required. This queries internal platform data.

For blockchain token balances (ETH, USDC, etc.), use the [Blockchain Balance](/docs/tools/blockchain-balance) tool instead.
