The token utility tools help discover contract addresses, validate token information, and explore available operations. These are read-only queries that require no wallet approval or gas fees.

## Overview

Use these tools to find token addresses by symbol or name, check whether a token is native to a network, and list all available blockchain operations. The assistant searches by symbol, name, and partial matches, returning verified token data to protect against scams.

## Tools

**resolve_token**: Find token contract addresses by symbol or name.

**is_native_token**: Check if a symbol represents a native blockchain token.

**list_tools**: Display all available blockchain operations.

## Examples

```
"Find USDC token"
"What's the address for LINK?"
"Is ETH a native token?"
"What tools do you have?"
"Search for Uniswap token"
```

## Token Resolution

The assistant searches by symbol (UNI), name (Uniswap), and partial matches. Results include contract address, decimals, and network availability. If multiple tokens match, specify the network to narrow results.

<Callout type="info">
Only verified tokens are recognized to protect against scam tokens. Custom token support by contract address is planned for a future release.
