Smart contract tools will enable deployment from audited templates, function calls on verified contracts, and transaction analysis through conversational commands. Both developers and non-technical users will interact with contracts using natural language.

<Callout type="warn" title="Coming Soon">
This feature is currently in development.
</Callout>

## Overview

Planned capabilities include deploying ERC20, ERC721, and multisig contracts from templates, calling read and write functions on any verified contract, decoding transaction data, and monitoring contract events. The assistant will explain function purposes and guide parameter configuration.

## Planned Features

**Deployment**: Deploy pre-audited templates (ERC20, ERC721, multisig) or custom verified code with guided parameter configuration.

**Interaction**: Call read and write functions on any verified contract. The assistant explains function purposes and parameter requirements.

**Analysis**: Decode transaction data, monitor events, and track contract state changes.

## Example Commands

```
"Deploy an ERC20 token called MyToken"
"Call balanceOf on USDC contract for my address"
"What does this transaction do?"
"Monitor Transfer events on USDC"
```
