The blockchain balance tool queries real-time token balances across all supported networks. It fetches data directly from blockchain nodes for native tokens like ETH, MATIC, and BNB, as well as ERC20 tokens including USDC, USDT, DAI, and over 60 others.

## Overview

## Examples

```
"What's my ETH balance?"
"Check USDC balance on Polygon"
"How much does 0x742d35Cc... have?"
"Show vitalik.eth balance"
"What's alice's USDT balance?"
```
