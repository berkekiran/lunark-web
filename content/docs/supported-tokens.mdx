<DocImage title="Supported Tokens" />

Lunark AI recognizes 69 major cryptocurrencies including native tokens, stablecoins, DeFi tokens, and Layer 2 tokens. You can use symbols like USDC, full names like USD Coin, or common aliases. The assistant resolves them automatically and handles decimal conversions.

## Overview

Only verified tokens are supported to protect against scam tokens. Token availability varies by network; the assistant validates token existence before operations.

## Token Categories

**Native Tokens**: ETH, MATIC, AVAX, BNB - used for gas and transfers on respective networks.

**Stablecoins**: USDC, USDT, DAI, BUSD, FRAX - USD-pegged tokens available on most networks.

**DeFi Tokens**: AAVE, COMP, UNI, SUSHI, CRV, LINK - protocol governance and utility tokens.

**Layer 2 Tokens**: ARB, OP - native tokens for Arbitrum and Optimism.

**Wrapped Tokens**: WETH, WBTC, WMATIC - ERC20 versions of native assets.

## Examples

```
"What's my USDC balance?"
"Send 100 DAI to alice"
"Find the LINK token address"
"Is ETH a native token?"
```

## Token Resolution

The assistant searches by symbol and name. If multiple tokens match, specify the network to narrow results. Contract addresses are validated against known token lists.

<Callout type="warn">
Custom token support by contract address is planned for a future release.
