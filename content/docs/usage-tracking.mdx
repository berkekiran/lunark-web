<DocImage title="Usage Tracking" />

Every interaction with Lunark AI consumes tokens based on message length and response complexity. The platform tracks all usage in real-time, providing detailed breakdowns of consumption and costs. Input tokens represent your messages, output tokens represent responses, with output costing more due to higher computational requirements.

## Overview

The usage system provides transparency into AI costs, helping you understand consumption patterns and optimize usage. All costs are displayed clearly with no hidden fees.

## Examples

```
"Show my usage history"
"What have I spent today?"
"How much credit do I have left?"
```

## Cost Breakdown

Each interaction records:
- Timestamp
- Input token count
- Output token count
- Base cost
- Platform fee (5%)
- Total cost
- Running balance

## Optimization Tips

Keep queries concise - "ETH balance" costs less than verbose requests. Use saved contacts instead of pasting long addresses. Leverage conversation context rather than repeating information. Combine related questions into single messages when possible.

<Callout type="info">
The assistant warns you when balance runs low. Operations stop at zero balance until top-up.
