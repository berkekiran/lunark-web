This guide walks you through connecting your wallet and making your first blockchain interactions with Lunark AI. You'll need a Web3 wallet like MetaMask, WalletConnect, or Coinbase Wallet with funds on a supported network. The entire setup takes less than a minute.

## Overview

Lunark AI operates as a non-custodial service. Your wallet credentials remain on your device, and all blockchain transactions require explicit approval through your wallet's signing interface.

## Setup

Click "Connect Wallet" to initiate the connection flow. Select your wallet provider and approve the connection request. You'll then sign a message to verify wallet ownership. This signature is free and doesn't incur gas fees.

<Callout type="warn">
The platform balance system is currently in private beta. Full functionality launches with Lunark AI v2.

## First Commands

```
"What's my ETH balance?"
"Show my USDC on Polygon"
"What networks do you support?"
"List my contacts"
```

For token transfers, the assistant displays transaction details and estimated gas before requesting wallet approval:

```
"Send 10 USDC to 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e"
"Transfer 0.1 ETH to alice"
```
