<DocImage title="What is Lunark AI?" />

Lunark AI is a conversational blockchain assistant that lets you interact with Web3 through natural language. Instead of navigating complex wallet interfaces and manually configuring transactions, you simply describe what you want in plain English. The assistant interprets your intent, validates parameters, and executes operations across seven major blockchain networks while keeping your private keys secure on your device.

## Overview

The platform supports Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, Avalanche, and BNB Chain. Core capabilities include balance checking, token transfers, contact management, network switching, and token approvals. All operations require explicit wallet confirmation. Your private keys never leave your device.

Lunark AI is built on [Astreus](https://astreus.org), an agentic framework that provides memory persistence, tool orchestration, and usage-based billing.

## Examples

```
"What's my ETH balance on Ethereum?"
"Send 100 USDC to alice on Polygon"
"Add bob as 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e"
"Switch to Arbitrum"
"Approve 500 USDC for Uniswap"
```

## Getting Started

Connect your Web3 wallet to begin. The assistant guides you through wallet verification and provides contextual help for all supported operations. See the [Quick Start](/docs/quick-start) guide for detailed setup instructions.
